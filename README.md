A thorough introduction into `list` and `tuple` in Python 3.

>***Author:*** Philip Wilkinson Head of _Science_ (21/22)

>***Contact:*** philip.wilkinson.19@ucl.ac.uk

>***Difficulty***: 2/5 ~ 3/5

>***Prerequisite***: `PY01` or basic Python syntax. Experience with `list`, `tuple`, `set` and `dictionary` is desirable, but we will take a closer look into the details.

## Description

In this workshop will will be introduced to the four main data structures in python of `list`, `tuple`, `set` and `dictionary`. We will take a closer at what makes these data structures unique, how we can use them and their unique methods and functions, covering a thorough introduction of each data structure. Even if you are familiar with the data stcutures, this workshop might be able to give you some insight into new methods or techniques and why certain data structures may be used in certain situations.
