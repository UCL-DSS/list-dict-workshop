    "### 1) [List](#List)\n",

    "### 2) [Tuple](#Tuple)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) [Set](#Sets)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) [Dictionary](#Dictionary)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we will take a closer look into the methods, arrtibutes, their usage and some implementation details of these structures. This should provide you with a thorough introduction into these data structures. even if you are familier with the data structures, the workshop might be able to give you some useful insight into why things are done in a certain way or learning a new method that you could use in your own implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, some key phrases are useful to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Mutable</b>: This means that the item can be changed. The opposite is immutable which means once the object has been created it cannot be changed\n",
    "- <b>Ordered</b>: This means that the way in which the items are stored will not be changed and can be accessed by knowing which order the item is stored in. The opposite of this is unordered where the items stored cannot be accessed by the order that they were placed in.\n",
    "- <b>Indexable</b>: This means that items can be accessed based on the order that they were introduced into the item using the index. This is only applicable for ordered objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to note the key attributes of data structures and what this can mean for their usefulness in term of both Python application and their presence in data science applications. While the majority of data science applications will use some form of the Pandas Dataframe that you will learn about in a future workshop, it is nonetheless useful to note what can be done with these other datatypes.\n"

The benefits of these are that you can assign information to them based on an individual key, for example if you had linked lists of names, scores and ages you could create a dictionary with each of these keys and lists for each. Alternatively if you had many cars and there was defined information for them you could create dictionaries for each of them with the keys representing the basic information. They also lay the foundation for more complex data storage methods such as pandas dataframes, JSON or others."
